# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-

Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

The idea of PCA is simple â€” reduce the number of variables of a data set, while preserving as much information as possible.
